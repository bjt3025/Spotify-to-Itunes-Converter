Psuedo code: 

Full project: 
Shortened verson: 
1. Take the JSON from current_user_saved_tracks and take the song name, artist, album, and possibly some other features 
    - turn into txt/JSON/CSV file to save data 
2. Use this song information to look these songs up on youtube and download them using an MP3 player
    - Hardest part: find a way to look up videos and grab their links 
    - How am I going to download these youtube videos using a Python MP3 player. 
    - did some research use pytube to download audio 

further work: 
1. take Spotify playlists and download their music and reconstruct playlist in itunes 
2. Hide api keys 


Work to do 12/18/2023: 
current_user_saved_tracks - done 
incorporate code from project 1 - done

Work to do 12/19/2023
learn how to execute searches using youtube api: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQmIOXydfO0- done
save a list of song links from youtube - done 

convert youtube link to audio file using python - done
store audio file on itunes - done 

12/20/2023: Original project finished 
Make sure songs are of high quality and do not take up an excessive amount of data: - done 
the song "love is only a feeling takes up" 2.4 MB this means in spotifys terms it would be High quality audio 

Convert youtube MP4 files to effiecent MP3 files - done  

- find a way to add songs directly into Itunes rather than a folder that needs to be placed in itunes 

- allows yourself to download playlists and store them in folders together - done 

- make it so every song has an image: might need to get song images from youtube - done 

- 

12/20/2023: 

- convert spotify url data to binary image data using downloading image into binary using requests library - done
- convert binary data into a jpeg image - done
    - if image download fails attempt another download
    - find a way to increase download speed 

- learn more about SSL 

- Fix SSL errors that are caused by the Pytube library 

- implement something in youtube_mp3 that retries the audio download if it fails  

- make it so folders full of songs can be turned into playlists on itunes

- make it so songs are directly added to itunes:


Improvements that could be done: 
- videos are turned into MP4 files and then are converted in MP3 files. This maybe slowing down the program
- learn more aboout requests library 


Utilizing Multi-threading: 
- In order to speed up the process of collecting audio data from youtube and then converting that data into an MP3 file in the Youtube_MP3 function. (which was by far the most time consuming part of running the program). I incorporated multi-threading to allow the program to download all of the songs concurrently. This resulted in a 190% increase in runtime
